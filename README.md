# Datadog Grafana Datasource Plugin

![Build Passing](https://travis-ci.org/voidfiles/grafana-datasource-datadog.svg?branch=master)

Datadog has a nice dashboard system, but I was having trouble creating a dashboard that combined multiple datasources and grafana was the easiest way to bring it all together.
